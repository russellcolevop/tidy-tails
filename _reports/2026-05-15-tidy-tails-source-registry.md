when: 2026-05-15
who: Cowork
purpose: Full source registry for the Tidy Tails contact-card reconciliation workstream. Every artifact in the chain — what it is, where it lives, what it proves, what it feeds into, and its privacy level. Intended for KoyaOS ingestion and as the durable reference any future session can load instead of re-deriving provenance.
status: current as of Phase 1 post-execution (2026-05-15)

# Tidy Tails — Source Registry

Every source in the reconciliation chain from contact-card photos to live Supabase writes. Read this before starting any new workstream session.

---

## S-01 — Supabase live database

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Kind** | live database |
| **Location** | Supabase project `pgkwovokciaqnbhpttba`, region us-east-1 |
| **Access** | Supabase MCP (execute_sql) |
| **Privacy** | HIGH — real customer data, Supabase anon key in v1 HTML |
| **Source-of-truth for** | canonical row IDs (UUIDs), appointment counts, RLS state |
| **Current state** | 137 clients / 188 pets / 730 appointments — confirmed post-Phase-3-COMMIT 2026-05-17 (was 131 / 181 / 730 post-Phase-2; was 268 / 352 / 730 pre-Phase-2) |
| **Feeds into** | Phase 1 UPDATE targets; Phase 2 dedup plan; Phase 3 INSERTs; post-run verification queries |
| **Notes** | Do not run multi-statement queries in one MCP call — only the last result is returned. Use UNION ALL for multi-table counts. |

---

## S-03 — 2022–2024 financial ledgers

| Field | Value |

| **Location** | Not in repo. Analyzed during reconciliation session. |
| **Privacy** | HIGH — client financial records |

| **Access** | Read tool (host path) or bash (`/sessions/zealous-elegant-turing/mnt/tidy-tails/_private/source-artifacts/2026-05-11-codex-extraction/`) |
| **Privacy** | HIGH — customer data; `_private/` is gitignored |
| **Coverage** | 32 owners, 38 pets, 219 appointments — an earlier batch/subset, not the full 268-client universe |
| **Source-of-truth for** | Rich per-pet detail: Typical_Fee, Special_Notes, Color, Sex, Colour — fields not captured in the Supabase import |
| **Codex pet IDs** | P001–P038. P010 = Theo Cooper allergy. P021 = Floyd Elford allergy. P022 = Phil Elford allergy. P033 = Sunday Kitchen breed/allergy. |

| **Feeds into** | Phase 1 allergy flags (S-1D); grooming notes; Phase 4 pet enrichment |
| **Notes** | These CSVs are an earlier extraction pass, not the full May 13 batch report. Do not treat as complete. Use card-batch report (S-07) as the comprehensive cross-reference. |
