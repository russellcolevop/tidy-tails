# Tidy Tails — Venture State Snapshot

---

## Product state

**v1 is live and in daily use.**

URL: `https://russell-labs.github.io/tidy-tails/home.html`

Five HTML modules: `home`, `index`, `intake`, `client`, `report`, `export`. Static HTML + direct browser-to-Supabase calls + Twilio-backed `send-sms` edge function. No auth. Samantha is the only user.

Samantha runs her full grooming business on v1: booking, intake, client lookup, appointment history, SMS reminders. This is not a demo or prototype.

**v2 is not started.** Design cards exist on Russell's wall. No code. V2 design-lock prep/spec exists, and Pawfinity logged-in recon is complete. Execution remains gated on V1_HARDENED and V2_DESIGN_LOCK.

---

## Database state

| Table | Count | Source |
|---|---|---|
| clients | 137 | Post-Phase-3 COMMIT live (2026-05-17). Was 131 pre-Phase-3, 268 pre-Phase-2. |
| pets | 188 | Post-Phase-3 COMMIT live (2026-05-17). Was 181 pre-Phase-3, 352 pre-Phase-2. |
| appointments | 730 | Unchanged through Phases 1, 2, and 3 (load-bearing invariant). |

The original 268 clients were bulk-imported from Excel in a 2-minute window on 2026-04-09 (21:26–21:28). The double-import created 115 duplicate phone groups; Phase 1B's Backway phone normalization consolidated this to 114 groups (101 two-row, 13 four-row = 140 ghost rows in the post-Phase-1 baseline).

**Phase 2 COMMITTED 2026-05-16.** 137 ghost client rows + 171 ghost pet rows removed (137 + 3 Landry ghosts retained); 38 appointments re-pointed from ghost client_ids to canonical client_ids; all 730 appointments preserved. Post-COMMIT verification confirmed 0 remaining duplicate phone groups outside Landry/Laundry, and 0 orphan appointment FKs. Execution report: `_reports/2026-05-16-phase-2-execution-report.md`.

**Phase 3 COMMITTED 2026-05-17.** 6 new clients (Mary Anca, Nancy Cauchi, Gardy, Ashley Nichols, Mary Nichols, Christina Kitchen) + 7 new pets (Whiskey, Ruby, Coco, Kahlúa, Merlyn, Vader, Winston) inserted. All 730 appointments preserved. Korrie Silver / Gavi held out: G5 rollback test caught an existing same-person row at phone `647-300-7952` with two within-client Gavi pet duplicates that need separate reconciliation. Execution report: `_reports/2026-05-17-phase-3-execution-report.md`.

**Landry/Laundry (705-796-0620) — 4 rows still present, deliberately excluded by Phases 1, 2, and 3.** Sam needs to clarify Cash vs Charlotte before a follow-up patch can clean this group.

**Korrie Silver / Gavi — held out by Phase 3 G5 catch.** Existing row at `647-300-7952` (client_id `56f4385b-b103-4aab-86a3-f18219d7aabe`) carries 8 appointments and two Gavi pet rows that need within-client dedup. Reconciliation pending Sam input on canonical phone format and Gavi identity. See `_reports/2026-05-16-phase-3-rollback-test-outcome.md`.

**Financial alignment:** Ledger = 731 rows / $57,881.25 gross. Supabase = 730 appointments / $57,821.25 gross. Delta = 1 appointment: Russell Cole / Kiwi, 2024-06-06, $60. Ledger and database are effectively aligned.

## Open risks

### R-1 — RLS permissive policies (SEVERITY: HIGH)

RLS is enabled on all six public tables but every SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE policy is `qual = true, roles = {public}`. The anon key is in v1's HTML. Anyone with the key can read or write arbitrary rows. Partial mitigation: DELETE policies dropped 2026-04-22, so anon can no longer delete rows. Full fix requires v2 auth. Do not add auth-sensitive features to v1 without closing this first.

### R-2 — No automated backups (SEVERITY: MEDIUM)

Supabase free tier. Manual logical dump at `venture-ops/backups/tidy-tails/` on Russell's Mac (not in repo). Last dump: 2026-05-15 (taken before Phase 1 execution — clients.csv 268 rows, pets.csv 352 rows). Note: `dump_supabase.py` does not exist on disk; backup was done via REST API workaround. Script should be written before next SQL phase.

### R-3 — v1 is load-bearing (SEVERITY: MEDIUM)

GitHub Pages auto-deploys on merge to `main`. Any query-shape or table-name change ships to Samantha immediately. Default is read-only on v1 schema. All Phase 1–4 changes are data-layer only (UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE on row content, no schema changes).

## Reconciliation workstream state

### Workstream A — BUILD doc parity
**Status: done** (2026-05-13). CONTEXT.md, ROADMAP.md, GLOSSARY.md, METRICS.md (stub), v1-final-state-spec.md (stub), v1-active-bugs.md (stub), koya_inputs/00_venture_brief.md (stub), HANDOFF.md all created.

### Workstream B — Contact-card reconciliation
**Status: in-progress.** 79 of ~268+ cards processed. Sam's 49-question review complete (69 rows in sam_review_responses). Phase 1 SQL generated, verified, executed, and spot-checked clean.

**Phase 1 — Safe UPDATEs**
- SQL: `_reports/2026-05-14-phase-1-safe-updates.sql`
- Review: `_reports/2026-05-14-phase-1-safe-updates-review.md`
- Verifier: `_reports/2026-05-14-phase-1-safe-updates-codex-verifier.md`
- Execution report: `_reports/2026-05-15-phase-1-execution-report.md`
- **Status: EXECUTED 2026-05-15 — verified clean**
- Scope: 29 UPDATEs across 18 client rows + 11 pet rows. No DELETEs, no INSERTs, no schema changes, no appointment mutations.
- Post-run: all 18 client rows + 11 pet rows spot-checked ✓. Appointments = 730 (unchanged) ✓. Clients = 268, pets = 352 (unchanged) ✓.

**Phase 2 — Dedup (ghost row deletion)**
- SQL: `_reports/2026-05-15-phase-2-dedup.sql` (set-based, temp-table-driven, 8 pre-write gates G1-G8 + 7 post-write invariants I1-I7, default ROLLBACK)
- Notes: `_reports/2026-05-15-phase-2-dedup-notes.md`
- Pre-flight output: `_reports/2026-05-15-phase-2-pre-flight-output.md`
- Execution report: `_reports/2026-05-16-phase-2-execution-report.md`
- **Status: COMMITTED 2026-05-16 — verified clean**
- Scope executed: 137 ghost client rows + 171 ghost pet rows deleted, 38 appointments re-pointed to canonical client_ids. 105 SAFE groups (113 ghosts) + 8 SPLIT_APPT groups (24 ghosts). Landry/Laundry (4 rows) deliberately excluded.
- Post-run: 131 clients, 181 pets, 730 appointments. 0 remaining duplicate phone groups outside Landry. 0 orphan appointment FKs. All gates and invariants passed.

**Phase 3 — New client + pet INSERTs**
- SQL: `_reports/2026-05-16-phase-3-inserts.sql` (set-based, temp-table-driven, 7 pre-write gates G1, G2, G3, G4, G5a, G5b, G6 + 7 post-write invariants I1-I7, default ROLLBACK)
- Plan: `_reports/2026-05-16-phase-3-insert-plan.md`
- Rollback-test outcome: `_reports/2026-05-16-phase-3-rollback-test-outcome.md` (documents the G5 catch on Korrie Silver and the resulting holdout decision)
- Execution report: `_reports/2026-05-17-phase-3-execution-report.md`
- **Status: COMMITTED 2026-05-17 — verified clean**
- Scope executed: 6 client INSERTs + 7 pet INSERTs (Korrie Silver client + Gavi pet held out per the rollback-test G5 catch).
- Post-run: 137 clients, 188 pets, 730 appointments. Landry/Laundry 4 rows untouched. Korrie holdout 1 row untouched. Dependent tables 0/0/0. 0 orphan appointment FKs. All gates and invariants passed.

**Phase 3.5 — Historical appointment backfills (planning only; not executed)**
- Plan: `_reports/2026-05-16-phase-3.5-appointment-backfills-plan.md`
- Status: planning only; depends on Phase 3 (now COMMITTED) for FK targets and a Sam-readback for date-ambiguous entries before SQL is drafted.
- Scope (strong-evidence): 3 Whiskey appointments (Mary Anca) + 2 Russell Cole / Kiwi appointments. Date-ambiguous deferrals: Kiwi 2024-07-??, Ruby 2024-08-??, Coco 2023-12-14.
- Scope: 7 new clients + 8 pets. Mary Anca, Nancy Cauchi, Gardy, Ashley Nichols, Mary Nichols (+ Merlyn), Korrie Silver / Gavi, Christina Kitchen / Winston.

**Phase 4 — Codex pet enrichment**
- Status: not written. Blocked on Phase 3.
- Scope: Backfill Typical_Fee, Special_Notes, Color, Sex from Codex extracted CSVs for ~38 pets.

### Workstream C — Pawfinity logged-in recon
**Status: complete (2026-05-15).** Codex performed a read-only logged-in recon. No live records were mutated, exported, messaged, scheduled, charged, or deleted.

Artifacts:
- `_reports/2026-05-15-pawfinity-logged-in-recon.md`
- `_reports/2026-05-15-pawfinity-v2-implications.md`

Product decision: Pawfinity validates the category and the wedge. Tidy v2 should not clone Pawfinity's broad legacy suite; it should build a mobile-first Samantha grooming cockpit centered on search, pet safety notes, quick groom logging, SMS reminders, lapsed clients, vaccination status, and simple revenue visibility.

## What to do next session

1. Write Phase 2 dedup SQL. Reference: `_reports/2026-05-14-reconciliation-plan.md`. 106 safe ghost-row deletions + 9 split-appt groups (need appointment re-pointing first). No execution without Russell approval.
2. Ask Sam: Landry/Laundry (705-796-0620) — Cash or Charlotte?
3. Write `venture-ops/dump_supabase.py` so future backups don't require REST API workaround.
4. Use the Pawfinity recon artifacts to keep v2 scope narrow: mobile-first search cockpit, pet safety cards, quick groom logging, SMS, lapsed clients, vaccination status, simple revenue.
5. Begin Phase 3 planning (7 new client INSERTs) once Phase 2 is approved and executed.
